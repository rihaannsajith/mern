            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Rihaan Sajith. I am currently in my third year of engineering studies, specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology. My passion for electronics and communication began early, influenced by my vibrant hometown of Kochi, Kerala, which has inspired me throughout my academic journey. Throughout my studies, I have actively engaged in various projects that challenge me and enhance my skills. One notable project is a multi-biometric home locking system that integrates fingerprint and facial recognition technologies to provide enhanced security and convenience. This project has been a significant learning experience, allowing me to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world applications. My academic pursuits are complemented by a keen interest in staying updated with the latest advancements in technology. I am dedicated to continuous learning and strive to contribute meaningfully to the field of electronics and communication. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that address real-world problems and to grow both personally and professionally in this dynamic field. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am open to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring opportunities that align with my interests and aspirations.</p>
